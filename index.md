## Introduction
Hi, I'm Liron! I'm a master's student at the Weizmann Institute, currently doing my lab rotations. 
Recently, I was doing my second rotation in Ofer Shoshani's lab, focusing on evolution of gene amplification in cancer.

Now, my last rotation is in Yonatan Stelzer's lab, which focuses on epigentic regulation in embryonic development.

## Background
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science at The Hebrew University, where I learned much about scientific research in human disease from a medical standpoint.  

## Research Interests
My research interests include molecular biology and systems biology to tackle complex problems such as cancer development and understanding its microenvironment. 

## Outside the Lab
When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy reading, writing and going on walks. These activities help me unwind from the day's work.
