## Introduction
Hi, I'm Liron! I'm a master's student at the Weizmann Institute, currently doing my lab rotations. 
Right now I'm doing my second rotation in Ofer Shoshani's lab:

## Background
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science at The Hebrew University, where I learned much about scientific research in human disease from a medical standpoint.  

## Research Interests
My research interests include molecular biology and systems biology to tackle complex problems such as cancer development and understanding its microenvironment. 

## Outside the Lab
When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy reading, writing and going on walks. These activities help me unwind from the day's work.
