## Introduction
Hi, I'm Liron! I'm a master's student at the WIS, currently doing my lab rotations. 
Now, my current rotation is in Yonatan Stelzer's lab, which focuses on epigentic regulation in embryonic development.

## Background
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science at The Hebrew University, where I learned much about scientific research in human disease.

## Outside the Lab
When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy reading, writing and going on walks. These activities help me unwind from the day's work.
